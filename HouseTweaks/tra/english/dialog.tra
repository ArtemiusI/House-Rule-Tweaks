@0    = ~If you still wish to turn in bandit scalps, you may speak with Officer Zelas. He will be assigned to Beregost in my stead.~
@1    = ~Remain here, Brage. We shall return to Nashkel once I am prepared.~
@2    = ~Then let's go immediately.~
@3    = ~Tarry not, I beg of you. I can hardly bear the shame of my actions for another moment.~
@4    = ~Are we to return to Nashkel? Please, please! I must face justice for my actions with whatever honor I have left, and I can wait no longer!~
@5    = ~Yes, let's go immediately.~
@6    = ~Not yet.~
@7    = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. Officer Vai has spoken highly of your character, and I am to take over her duties here in Beregost. If you wish to exchange any more bandit scalps in the future, speak to me.~
@8    = ~I have bandit scalps to turn in.~
@9    = ~Farewell.~
@10   = ~Good <DAYNIGHT> to you, <CHARNAME>. Do you need anything?~
@11   = ~Not at the moment.~
@12   = ~You have some nerve showing your face around here. Your reputation precedes you, <CHARNAME>. In the name of the Flaming Fist, you are sentenced to death!~
@13   = ~Greetings, friend. Might I have a moment of your time?~
@14   = ~What is it?~
@15   = ~Make it quick.~
@16   = ~I bring regards from Lady Elgea, whom you rescued from those wretched kidnappers days ago. She has asked me to personally deliver these to you.~
@17   = ~It was originally agreed for us to exchange it as ransom for the lady's freedom, but since that is no longer necessary, and as you are still owed a reward for your actions, she feels it is appropriate that you take it instead.~
@18   = ~It will do. Thank you.~
@19   = ~I'll find a use for these... somehow.~
@20   = ~Farewell. Good fortune to you.~
@21   = ~Wait. Would you be willing to part with the Deck of Many Things?~
@22   = ~You desire the Deck, hmm? I cannot say I blame you. It is a most wondrous thing. Dangerous, of course, but that only makes the draw more exciting.~
@23   = ~I suppose I could be persuaded to bargain for it. After all, it would only be a matter of time before it takes my life. Such is the risk of the game, and it can only amuse me for so long.~
@24   = ~Here is my offer, prime. I will give you the deck, in exchange for one of your prior wagersï¿½ your experience, or your vitality. Such a trade is not unreasonable, I assure you. Though the deck bears many dangers, it also grants great rewards to the daring. What do you say?~
@25   = ~I accept. Take a portion of my experience.~
@26   = ~I accept. Take a portion of my vitality.~
@27   = ~Never mind. The cost is a little too steep.~
@28   = ~I think I'll just kill you for the deck instead.~
@29   = ~As you wish. The deck is yours, prime. Use it well, and may you live to bestow it upon another some day.~
@30   = ~Now you must excuse my rudeness, but I really should be going. The planes await!~
@31   = ~The wiser choice, perhaps. Well then, long life to you, prime.~
@32   = ~An inscription on the demonic statue reads: 
Place an animal sacrifice before great Demogorgon, and awaken his children from their long sleep.~
@33   = ~Utter a sanctifying prayer upon the altar.~
@34   = ~Strike the altar.~
@35   = ~Leave.~
@36   = ~You sense the rage of several demonic presences in response to your desecration of the unholy altar...~
